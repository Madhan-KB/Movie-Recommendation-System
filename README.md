# Movie-Recommendation-System
A simple and efficient Machine Learning–based Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar movies based on user input. The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity to measure movie-to-movie relationships. It also includes a clean frontend UI (HTML/CSS/JS) and a backend API to serve model predictions.
